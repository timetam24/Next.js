export default async function Page() {
  // Page is an async component. This allows you to use await to fetch data.

  // A "waterfall" refers to a sequence of network requests that depend on the completion of previous requests. In the case of data fetching, each request can only begin once the previous request has returned data.
  // For example, we need to wait for fetchRevenue() to execute before fetchLatestInvoices() can start running, and so on.

  const latestInvoices = await fetchLatestInvoices();
  const {
    numberOfCustomers,
    numberOfInvoices,

    totalPendingInvoices,
  } = await fetchCardData();
  // This pattern is not necessarily bad. There may be cases where you want waterfalls because you want a condition to be satisfied before you make the next request. For example, you might want to fetch a user's ID and profile information first. Once you have the ID, you might then proceed to fetch their list of friends. In this case, each request is contingent on the data returned from the previous request.
  // However, this behavior can also be unintentional and impact performance.
