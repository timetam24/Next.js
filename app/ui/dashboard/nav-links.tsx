// A common UI pattern is to show an active link to indicate to the user what page they are currently on. To do this, you need to get the user's current path from the URL. Next.js provides a hook called usePathname() that you can use to check the path and implement this pattern. Since usePathname() is a hook, you'll need to turn nav-links.tsx into a Client Component. Add React's "use client" directive to the top of the file, then import usePathname() from next/navigation:
'use client';

import {
  UserGroupIcon,
  HomeIcon,
  DocumentDuplicateIcon,
} from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
// You should now be able to navigate between the pages without seeing a full refresh.

// 1. Automatic code-splitting
// To improve the navigation experience, Next.js automatically code splits your application by route segments. This is different from a traditional React SPA, where the browser loads all your application code on initial load. Splitting code by routes means that pages become isolated. If a certain page throws an error, the rest of the application will still work.

// 2. prefetching
// Futhermore, in production, whenever <Link> components appear in the browser's viewport, Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked route in the background. By the time the user clicks the link, the code for the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and this is what makes the page transition near-instant!

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';
import clsx from 'clsx';

// Map of links to display in the side navigation.
// Depending on the size of the application, this would be stored in a database.
const links = [
  { name: 'Home', href: '/dashboard', icon: HomeIcon },
  {
    name: 'Invoices',
    href: '/dashboard/invoices',
    icon: DocumentDuplicateIcon,
  },
  { name: 'Customers', href: '/dashboard/customers', icon: UserGroupIcon },
];

  const pathname = usePathname();
